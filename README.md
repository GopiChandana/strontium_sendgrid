## About The Project

[SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)

SendGrid is a cloud-based email service that provides reliable transactional email delivery, scalability, and real-time analytics along with flexible APIs that make custom integration easy. Common SendGrid use cases include:

* Automatically sending receipts or purchase confirmations to customers.
* Administering distribution lists for sending customers monthly fliers and promotions.
* Collecting real-time metrics for things like blocked email and customer engagement.
* Forwarding customer inquiries.
* Processing incoming emails.

For more information, visit https://sendgrid.com or SendGrid's C# library GitHub repo.

when we open this website:
* we will be directed to the product landing page then you can see the different roles, which is implemented by JS functionality.
* On the signin page, you can see signin details.
It is a good experience and learning while building this clone of sendgrid.com.
